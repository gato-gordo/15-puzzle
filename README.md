# 15-puzzle

## About

This repo generates a picture puzzle variation on the classic [15-puzzle]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle").  A new puzzle is generated from a random image divided into 16 pieces.  The bottom right-hand corner piece is then removed and the remaining pieces, including the emptied slot, are shuffled to initiate game play.

To solve the 15-puzzle, drag pieces vertically or horizontally adjacent to the empty slot and drop them into it. When the puzzle is solved, the pieces will compose the original source image with the empty slot in the bottom right-hand corner.

The UI is implemented in ReactJS and uses the Unsplash API to fetch random images.
